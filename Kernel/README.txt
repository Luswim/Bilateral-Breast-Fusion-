The Toolbox of Level Set Methods (ToolboxLS) is a collection of Matlab
routines that implement numerical algorithms to approximate the
solution of the time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) partial
differential equation (PDE) in any number of dimensions.  The HJ PDE
is often used for simulating dynamic implicit surfaces in animation
and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and it is of independent
interest in areas of optimal control, differential games, robotics,
financial mathematics, continuous reachability, etc.

This Toolbox is a modified version of Ian M. Mitchell's ToolboxLS http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mitchell/ToolboxLS
